# Algorithm Explorer

Algorithm Explorer is a Python desktop application built using Tkinter that allows users to explore and run various algorithms. The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting algorithms, inputting data, and displaying results.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose from a list of algorithms to explore.
- **Dynamic Input Forms**: The input interface changes based on the selected algorithm, allowing users to input relevant data.
- **Documentation**: A popup feature provides descriptions of each algorithm.
- **Result Display**: After submitting the input, the application processes the data and displays the results of the algorithm.
- **Dark Theme**: The application features a clean and consistent dark theme for a modern look.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Programming (LP)**
   - Revised Simplex Method
   - Simplex Algorithm
   - Two-Phase Method

2. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Prim’s Algorithm
   - Kruskal’s Algorithm
   - Graph Coloring
   - Bellman’s Algorithm

3. **Shortest Path Algorithms**
   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
   - Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
